* There are four ways of enabling discipline: delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth and balancing.
* The the feeling of being valuable is essential to mental health and is a corner stone of self-discipline.
* Problems do not go away. They must be worked through or else they remain forever a barrier to the growth and development of the spirit.
* The inclination to ignore the problems is a simple manifestation of unwillingness to delay gratification.
* It is said, "Neurotics makes themselves miserable; but those with character disorder make everyone else miserable."
* In attempting to avoid the pain of responsibility, millions and even billions daily attempt to escape from freedom.
* Frequently people's need to cling to their own reality-definition(maps), and fight against losing them is so great that therapy becomes impossible.
* No act is more unnatural, and hence more human, than the act of entering psychotherapy.
* Genuine psychotherapy is a legitimate shortcut to personal growth which often is ignored.
* To be free, we must assume total responsibility for ourselves, but in doing so, one must possess the capacity to reject the responsibility that is not truly theirs.
* Sometimes giving up is integral part of growing up.
* What provides the motive, the energy for discipline? The force I believe is love.
* Love is too large, too deep ever to be truly understood or measured or limited within a framework of words.
* Love is not effortless, but on the contrary, love is effortful.
